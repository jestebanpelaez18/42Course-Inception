# What is a container # 
Containers is like a box that contains everything our application need to run, everything that our application needs
is Â¡nside there. These makes everything simple, because we can run it in any computer, we dont need to worry about instalation, updates ... 

Docker will handle those containers.

# Docker images #

They are like blueprints for Containers, and it contents the next things:
-Runtime Enviroment
-Application code
-Any dependencies
-Extran config
-Commands

So basically when we run a image, we are creating a container, it means we are running our application. The containers are isolated, it already have everything for run the application no matter what version we have in our computer, it works independet. Because of that we can share the image with many users, and they dont need to install anything in his computer, everything is done by docker.
